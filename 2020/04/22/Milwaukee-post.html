<h2>Genertated by gpt2</h2>
<p>Buying your first home in Milwaukee could be expensive, depending on where you live and how much it’s going to cost you, but judging by the location of your home, you’ll have to pay more to live here.
The largest zip code in the Milwaukee area, 92020, is also the ZIP code with the highest number of homes purchased — 208,734 homes sold, according to data obtained by the Journal Sentinel from the DIA information unit. That suggests that there’s a pretty big property market here, and that buyers are actively pulling out of the housing market across the neighborhoods.
But as we pointed out earlier, Milwaukee is one of the more expensive places to buy a home in the Midwest. Your overall home sale price is $1,309 — a little less than a typical sale price, but not all that low.
Personally, I think the greatest difference between your average purchase price and the sale price is the insured property value. If you insure your home for 5% more than the selling price, it’s going to cost you $2,192 more in total premiums, just from the upfront purchase price. Conversely, if you insure it for 10% less than the selling price, your insurer will likely give you a lower premium (just as the higher premiums require your home to be insured).
The larger your home is — the more dwelling coverage you need — the higher your monthly premiums will be.
There are a number of risk factors that go into determining your homeowners insurance premium: your personal property coverage amount, the age and build of your home, and how much coverage you need. A home with higher coverage limits or a more comprehensive policy is going to be well protected, whereas a home with smaller coverage limits or a different type of coverage is going to need to be more expensively insured.
The age of your home also influences how much personal property coverage you need and when you need it. If your home is new and you need coverage up front, the insurer may give you a discount for being younger.
How much personal property you need depends on a number of different factors, including the type of roof you have, the style of cabinetry and countertops, roofing materials, and the structure of your home. If your roof is newly installed and you need coverage up front, your agent or broker will likely give you a discount on your policy.</p>
