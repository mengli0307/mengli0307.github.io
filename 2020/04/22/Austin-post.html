    <h1>Austin homeowners need to be aware of potential water damage from the hot temperatures, especially if you live near the coast.</h1>
<h2>Genertated by gpt2</h2>
<ol>
<li>Call your insurer.</li>
<li>If they don't offer summer coverage, get a plan from a specialized agent in the area you live.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the part numbers on your policy. Most coverages will have a limit of around $25,000 before there's a sign that something is covered (typical limit is around $10,000). If that limit is reached, the deluge will cause your policy to lapse.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the date of the sign. Things like date of birth, marriage, and death are all treated as water damage from the hot weather. The insurer will likely treat water damage from a hurricane or flood as well.</li>
<li>If you have a standard homeowners insurance policy, your personal property (and liability claims) will all be covered. Exceptions are flood damage to an individual structure (5 perils) or theft (if the owner of the property was negligent). If you have a flood insurance exemption, your personal property will be covered up to the policy limit ($1,000).</li>
<li>To make sure you're protected against flood damage, you need to make sure that your home has adequate flood coverage. In some cases, a standard policy might not cover wind and hail damage, so you need to get separate policies or an endorsement if you live in an area that’s susceptible to flooding.</li>
<li>If your home has a structure to protect it from wind and hail, that structure usually won’t be covered even if it’s damaged by a covered peril. For that reason, you’ll want to make sure your home has adequate flood coverage even if it’s located in a high-risk area.</li>
<li>If your home is located in a coastal community and you’re forced to live inland, you may be required by your insurer to relocate to a coastal community in order to get covered. Especially if you’re a coastal-area homeowner and forced to live inland, your insurer may require that you relocate to a local tax exempt region in order to get hurricane or windstorm coverage.</li>
