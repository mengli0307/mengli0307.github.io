        <div><h1>Flooding in Sioux City</h1>
<h2>Genertated by gpt2</h2>
<p>Sioux City flooding advisory issued strongly recommends that you stay off the roads and sidewalks. Highways and Terminals are clogged. Transport trucks are stuck. And before the rain let up, the soil collapses from west to east. The same manifests in other cities, including Boston's outdoor playground that sustained a sinkhole
in public park, Cambridge Montessori Lake Park, and the Cambridge Water Park tunnel that feeds the Creedmoor Park Trail. In Lexington, Buchanan County Emergency Management Agency Director Tim Jonovich said crews responded to northeast Lexington and southeast Huntington Township."It was the flow of people, vehicles and businesses that made it difficult to clear," Jonovich said. "We were scrambling to get aid to people who were already there."The IRA has circulated a list of the town's top FEMA applicants for disaster assistance a day after
the floodwaters provided by the storm. Lexington Public Schools, Jordan Middle School and Winchester Holmes Community College Mayor Mike Spaeth said he was working with the agency to make sure applications are being received. In Rochester, public works officials urged patience."We are trying our best, but there are many people ahead of us who are just frustrated and didn't feel secure," Mayor Mike Ryan said. "We need to work extra hard to make sure that we are making people comfortable again."Another hour of rain is forecast in Topeka at 12:30 p.m. in northern Lawrence County, according to the National Weather Service. A total of 2.8 million customers in the county were without power Tuesday morning. Rochester Utilities Administrator Anthony McDade said the utility understood the premature closure of several roads in the county and agreed to open the bridges and overhead wires so crews could clear the roads safely. The work took more than two days, McDade said. He estimated that cleanup and restoration of roads and utility lines would take another two or three days."We had those high winds that brought down trees that brought down powerlines and pushed wires down, and now the people
need to start rebuilding," McDade said.</p>
