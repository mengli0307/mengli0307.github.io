    <h1>Insurance in Tulsa, Oklahoma</h1>
<h2>Genertated by gpt2</h2>
<p>The relentless Oklahoma tornadoes that brought death and damage over the last few years have prompted an increase in insurance premiums in the state, according to Thomas Fallace, an insurance consultant who has worked in Oklahoma for nearly 15 years. The state usually sets the premiums for the National Weather Service in January, reflecting the earliest date of a tornado landfall. But last fiscal year, Oklahoma City almost hit the mark, with a December tornado that is attributed to a tornado that hit during the previous year's tornado season. More: Unlock your home insurance value with Policygenius — we understand how you truly spent your money from retirement — even if you didn't leave the state. This year has been the most expensive for Oklahoma insurance in history, with premiums rising to nearly $1,000 a year on average. The average annual premium for homeowners insurance by the end of 2019 was $1,192 in 2015, according to the most recent rate data provided by the Oklahoma Department of Insurance. Meanwhile, the state’s average monthly premium for auto insurance was $1,624 last month. In the Oklahoma example, that same group of consumers also tended to prefer the cheaper coverage. Of those who preferred insurance only last year, 78% paid for homeowners insurance in 2019. That represents a 10% increase over the previous year’s figures. In addition to premiums, Oklahoma residents are also contributing to the cost of structures elsewhere in the state that are nearing completion. Most of the state’s farmland and ranching fields and buildings have been approved for demolition or redevelopment, and construction materials are gradually being replaced. Meanwhile, all this is also contributing to a spike in premiums for auto and homeowners’ auto policies. The cost of using a vehicle in Oklahoma last year fell to its lowest point in December, while premiums for a typical auto policy rose about 6% last month, compared with 14% a year earlier, Denico said.</p>
