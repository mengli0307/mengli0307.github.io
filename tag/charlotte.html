<h2>Genertated by gpt2</h2>
<p>Charlotte insurance officials initially said they would have to extend coverage without an increase in premiums.  But after months of reviewing their policies, the state last year passed a law that limited how much insurance companies can raise their rates.SB 129 gives unified ability to publicize or add new businesses and bars. The law makes it easier for most bar owners to offer in-network rates, and encourages businesses to provide ancillary services such as marketing, operational solutions and technology for customers. Nationally, the law gives general insurance companies – such as JPS and Wells Fargo – to increase rates by 15% to 20%. Merchants must also offer ancillary services such as marketing, operational solutions and technology for those businesses that choose not to raise their rates. The law also clarifies the utility responsibilities for public utility customers and private insurance companies that sell electricity to customers. The new law takes effect July 1, 2017. Like other consumer protections, the law extols the shoveling process from businesses that violate the affordability standards established by the state. "No person shall, before, taking property or wealth in the Commonwealth of North Carolina shall, directly or indirectly, participate in the complete or any portion of such property processing before, during or after any such time period," the law states. So far, the law has made it easier for residents to find affordable rates, but the repeal of the law, and a proposed extension, are expected to deliver richer, more autonomous business experiences. The law is also expected to  clarify the state’s utility conservation goals. Previously, the state worried it would hamper developers’ plans for new affordable housing. The new law allows them to propose and pay for alternatives that did not violate the affordability standards. The law also clarifies the state’s power planning standards. Previously, the state hurdle for building solar panels was an §9.68. The new law allows approval of chips as old as a quarter-century old and up to a year, and new homes could get a stamp of green lighting. The changes were made as part of the 2017 legislative session, but the new law goes into effect in July 2017. July 2017 law changes allow homeowners and rente
rs to choose their electricity source and have chances to receive discounts on future electricity bills.</p>
